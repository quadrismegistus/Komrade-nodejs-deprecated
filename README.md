# Komrade

A socialist network

## Idea

Much of our life today is lived on social networks owned and operated by two or three of the largest, multinational companies in the world. These companies harvest every click and view of our digital lives, stretching back 20 years now, which they employ hundreds of thousands of employees to analyze in order to squeeze every last drop out of profit. In the process, newspapers are destroyed, writers become 'content producers' caught in a wave of click and circulation not of their designing. These platforms have become the infrastructure of all social life, and yet they are privately owned by a handful of out-of-touch white male billionaires.

But we don't need these fools. The technology's simple. Let's just make our own network: a *socialist* network. One that is private, secure, insurveillable, unmonetizable; one which would give people the security they need to communicate about whatever they want, including protesting against capital and the state.
