# Komrade

A socialist network

## Idea

Most of our lives on the internet are now lived on social netwoks owned and operated by the largest companies in the world. These companies harvest our data, stitching it to data they collect elsewhere across the internet all to feed its advertising learning algorithms. These platforms have become the public infrastructure of all social life, and yet they are privately owned by a handful of out-of-touch white men billionaires.

But we don't need those fools. The technology is quite simple. Let's try to make a new kind of social network: a *socialist* network. One which is private, secure, insurveillable, unmonetizable, which would give people the security they need to communicate about whatever they want, including protesting against the state, police, and capitalists.
