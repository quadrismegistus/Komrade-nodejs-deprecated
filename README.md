# Komrade
Social network for the revolution

## Idea

Tool to meet fellow comrades in your area and organize with them

## Features

### Friendship building

*  See other leftists in your area

* These profiles could be restricted in privacy...
	* made public to the whole internet
	* restricted to distance radius
    * restricted to existing komrades (and maybe their komrades too, etc)

* Add these people as 'komrades' to send messages, follow posts, etc

### Organizing

* Organize events secretly or publicly

* Restrict to komrades or people in the area

* Allow invitation to filter through trust/komrade network


### Discussing

* Post discussions of things either local to your area or globally

* Reddit-style upvoting?


### Dating?

* Mark someone as a 'kutie'; if they mark you as a kutie back, you match

* No one ever has to know if you've marked someone as cute unless they mark you back: avoids embarrassment


## Rules

*   No cops!

## Helping development

Please help! I'm in over my head here with web development and design.

### Installation

Run:

```
git clone https://github.com/quadrismegistus/Komrade.git
cd Komrade/webapp
yarn
yarn start
```

And you should be good to go.
